    "I have added tests to this code, whenever they are deployed, but these tests run on my local ide, but whenever i push them to github, they are failing on github actions, how can i solve this? the latest error that I was getting was that, \"\nnpm warn deprecated node-pre-gyp@0.13.0: Please upgrade to @mapbox/node-pre-gyp: the non-scoped node-pre-gyp package is deprecated and only the @mapbox scoped package will recieve updates in the future\nVercel CLI 25.1.0\n\nVercel CLI 25.1.0\nRetrieving project\u2026\n\nRetrieving project\u2026\nError!

",
    "wait what just happened, my github login is open, the website,and you made changes but i dont follow, what is happening? the github website asks for a code, what do i need to do now? do i need the app? i dont see any code. what am i supposed to do? ",
    "can you monitor the workflow under the Production \u2013 cads-research and then see what issues it has? did you fix the vercel Key not correct issue and is the code ready for deployment now? ",
    "sorry for exiting that go on with what you were doing. ",
    "What is wrong? Can you explicitly say that and maybe I can give you the correct credentails and you can do that. ",
