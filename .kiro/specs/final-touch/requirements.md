# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CADS Research Visualization System requires a comprehensive final reorganization to eliminate technical debt, fix critical CI/CD issues, and prepare the codebase for production handoff. This reorganization must preserve all existing functionality while establishing a clean, maintainable structure that eliminates duplicate files, consolidates redundant documentation, organizes scattered scripts, and enables proper database testing in CI environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CI/CD Pipeline Integrity

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want database tests to run in CI environments, so that production database issues are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL execute all database tests without skipping
2. WHEN database tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL use proper test database configuration
3. WHEN database connection tests execute THEN the system SHALL validate connectivity using CI environment variables
4. IF database tests fail in CI THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and report specific failure details
5. WHEN all database tests pass THEN the system SHALL proceed with the deployment pipeline

### Requirement 2: File Duplication Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each file to exist in exactly one canonical location, so that there is no confusion about which version is authoritative.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the repository THEN the system SHALL identify all duplicate files at root and subdirectory levels
2. WHEN duplicate files are found THEN the system SHALL preserve the canonical version in the appropriate subdirectory
3. WHEN removing duplicates THEN the system SHALL verify that no functionality depends on the duplicate file paths
4. IF critical files exist in multiple locations THEN the system SHALL establish a single source of truth
5. WHEN file deduplication is complete THEN the system SHALL have no duplicate app.js, index.html, or requirements.txt files

### Requirement 3: Documentation Consolidation

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want clear, non-redundant documentation, so that I can understand the system without information overload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL identify all redundant summary documents
2. WHEN consolidating documentation THEN the system SHALL preserve essential information while removing duplicates
3. WHEN creating the final documentation structure THEN the system SHALL establish a clear hierarchy with single-purpose documents
4. IF multiple documents cover the same topic THEN the system SHALL merge them into one comprehensive document
5. WHEN documentation consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL have no more than one summary document per major topic

### Requirement 4: Script Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want scripts organized in logical subdirectories with clear purposes, so that I can easily find and use the correct script for each task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing scripts THEN the system SHALL categorize all scripts into migration, processing, and utilities subdirectories
2. WHEN moving scripts THEN the system SHALL preserve all working functionality and relative import paths
3. WHEN scripts are organized THEN the system SHALL maintain clear documentation about which scripts to use for each purpose
4. IF legacy scripts exist THEN the system SHALL move them to appropriate legacy subdirectories
5. WHEN script organization is complete THEN the system SHALL have no scripts scattered at the root scripts/ level

### Requirement 5: Core Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all existing functionality to remain intact after reorganization, so that the production system continues to work without regression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganizing files THEN the system SHALL preserve all core processing logic in cads/data_loader.py and cads/process_data.py
2. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL maintain all visualization functionality in visuals/public/app.js
3. WHEN restructuring THEN the system SHALL preserve database schema definitions and working migration scripts
4. IF file paths change THEN the system SHALL update all references to maintain functionality
5. WHEN reorganization is complete THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests without modification

### Requirement 6: Data Flow Integrity

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the data processing pipeline to remain functional after reorganization, so that research data continues to flow correctly from source to visualization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganizing THEN the system SHALL maintain the OpenAlex API → Database → CADS Pipeline → Visualization data flow
2. WHEN moving data files THEN the system SHALL preserve the data/processed/ → visuals/public/data/ synchronization
3. WHEN restructuring THEN the system SHALL maintain all working API configurations and rate limiting
4. IF data paths change THEN the system SHALL update all pipeline scripts to use correct paths
5. WHEN data flow testing is complete THEN the system SHALL successfully process a complete data pipeline run

### Requirement 7: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage that runs in all environments, so that code quality is maintained throughout development and deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute unit tests, integration tests, and CI/CD pipeline tests
2. WHEN tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL use appropriate test database configurations
3. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve existing coverage levels
4. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information for debugging
5. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL confirm that no functionality regression has occurred

### Requirement 8: Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want the reorganized codebase to be production-ready with clear handoff documentation, so that deployment and maintenance can proceed smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for handoff THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive handoff documentation
2. WHEN documenting the system THEN the system SHALL include setup procedures, maintenance tasks, and emergency procedures
3. WHEN organizing for production THEN the system SHALL maintain all working deployment configurations
4. IF issues exist THEN the system SHALL document known issues and workarounds clearly
5. WHEN handoff is complete THEN the system SHALL enable a new developer to set up and maintain the system independently
