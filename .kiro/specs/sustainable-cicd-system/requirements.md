# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature encompasses the development of a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, extensive test coverage, operational documentation, and sustainability engineering for the CADS Research Visualization System. The goal is to transform the current system into a production-ready, maintainable, and highly performant platform that can scale and operate reliably over time with minimal manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated CI/CD pipeline that validates, tests, and deploys code changes, so that I can confidently release updates without manual intervention and ensure code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN the system SHALL run automated linting, type checking, and security scans
2. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL execute the full test suite including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
3. WHEN all tests pass on main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to production environment
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify developers with detailed failure reports
5. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL perform health checks and rollback if issues are detected
6. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically test compatibility and security vulnerabilities

### Requirement 2: Extensive Test Coverage and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want comprehensive test coverage across all system components, so that I can detect regressions early and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Python code is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain minimum 90% test coverage
2. WHEN JavaScript visualization code is changed THEN the system SHALL run browser-based automated tests
3. WHEN database schema changes THEN the system SHALL run migration tests and data integrity checks
4. WHEN ML pipeline executes THEN the system SHALL validate output quality and performance benchmarks
5. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL test response times, error handling, and data accuracy
6. WHEN system loads THEN the system SHALL perform load testing to ensure performance under expected traffic

### Requirement 3: Performance and Sustainability Engineering

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to be optimized for speed, resource efficiency, and long-term sustainability, so that it can handle growth while minimizing operational costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the visualization THEN the system SHALL load initial view within 2 seconds
2. WHEN data processing pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL complete within 10 minutes for full dataset
3. WHEN serving static assets THEN the system SHALL utilize CDN caching and compression for 95%+ cache hit rate
4. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms for 95% of queries
5. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN the system SHALL automatically scale based on demand
6. WHEN code is deployed THEN the system SHALL minimize bundle sizes and optimize for Core Web Vitals

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Operational Documentation

**User Story:** As a new team member or operator, I want detailed documentation covering system operation, troubleshooting, and maintenance, so that I can effectively manage and contribute to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the system THEN documentation SHALL provide step-by-step installation and configuration guides
2. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN documentation SHALL include common problems, solutions, and debugging procedures
3. WHEN performing maintenance THEN documentation SHALL cover backup procedures, updates, and monitoring
4. WHEN onboarding developers THEN documentation SHALL explain architecture, development workflow, and contribution guidelines
5. WHEN deploying changes THEN documentation SHALL detail deployment procedures and rollback processes
6. WHEN monitoring system health THEN documentation SHALL explain metrics, alerts, and response procedures

### Requirement 5: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities, so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system components run THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on performance, errors, and usage patterns
2. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL send alerts to designated channels with severity levels
3. WHEN users interact with the system THEN the system SHALL track user experience metrics and conversion funnels
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed logs with context for debugging
5. WHEN system health degrades THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing real-time status and trends
6. WHEN capacity limits approach THEN the system SHALL proactively alert before resource exhaustion

### Requirement 6: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want the system to follow security best practices and maintain compliance with academic data handling requirements, so that sensitive research data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling data THEN the system SHALL encrypt data in transit and at rest
2. WHEN users access the system THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate authentication and authorization
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL have automated scanning and patching procedures
4. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs of all data access and modifications
5. WHEN third-party dependencies are used THEN the system SHALL regularly scan for security vulnerabilities
6. WHEN sensitive configuration is managed THEN the system SHALL use secure secret management practices

### Requirement 7: Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

**User Story:** As a system stakeholder, I want robust backup and recovery procedures, so that the system can quickly recover from failures and continue serving users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system data changes THEN the system SHALL automatically backup data with point-in-time recovery capability
2. WHEN infrastructure fails THEN the system SHALL failover to backup systems within 5 minutes
3. WHEN disasters occur THEN the system SHALL have documented recovery procedures with RTO of 1 hour
4. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL regularly test backup integrity and restoration procedures
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL maintain version-controlled infrastructure as code
6. WHEN recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL provide automated restoration tools and procedures
