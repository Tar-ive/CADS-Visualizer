# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CADS Research Visualization System currently has a basic test suite that primarily focuses on structural validation and file existence checks. This feature aims to transform the testing infrastructure into a comprehensive, production-ready test suite that ensures code quality, reliability, security, and performance across all system components.

The enhanced test suite will provide developers with confidence in their changes, enable continuous integration/deployment, and ensure the system meets enterprise-grade quality standards for academic research visualization platforms.

4. WHEN memory usage tests run THEN they SHALL verify the system operates within defined memory constraints
5. WHEN performance benchmarks execute THEN they SHALL generate detailed performance reports with recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive frontend tests that validate user interactions and accessibility, so that all users can effectively use the visualization interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend tests run THEN they SHALL validate all interactive elements using automated browser testing
2. WHEN testing accessibility THEN the system SHALL comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
3. WHEN cross-browser tests execute THEN they SHALL verify compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
4. WHEN testing responsive design THEN the interface SHALL function correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
5. WHEN UI tests complete THEN they SHALL generate visual regression reports comparing against baseline screenshots

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want data quality and validation tests that ensure ML pipeline accuracy, so that research visualizations are scientifically reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data validation tests run THEN they SHALL verify embedding quality and dimensionality consistency
2. WHEN testing clustering algorithms THEN the system SHALL validate cluster quality metrics and stability
3. WHEN validating research data THEN tests SHALL ensure data completeness and accuracy against source APIs
4. WHEN testing data transformations THEN the system SHALL verify mathematical correctness of UMAP and HDBSCAN outputs
5. WHEN data integrity tests complete THEN they SHALL generate data quality reports with statistical summaries

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want infrastructure and deployment tests that validate system configuration, so that deployments are reliable and environments are properly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment tests run THEN they SHALL validate all environment variables and configuration settings
2. WHEN testing database migrations THEN the system SHALL verify schema changes apply correctly without data loss
3. WHEN validating service dependencies THEN tests SHALL confirm all external services are accessible and responsive
4. WHEN testing backup and recovery THEN the system SHALL validate data restoration procedures
5. WHEN infrastructure tests complete THEN they SHALL generate environment health reports

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved test organization and tooling that makes testing efficient and maintainable, so that writing and maintaining tests is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN they SHALL be categorized by type (unit, integration, e2e, performance, security)
2. WHEN running tests THEN developers SHALL have granular control over test execution with filtering and tagging
3. WHEN test fixtures are needed THEN they SHALL be reusable across multiple test files with proper cleanup
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed debugging information with logs and context
