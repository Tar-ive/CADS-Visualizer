## 🧹 Code Cleanup Completed

### Test File Organization
**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Moved `test_visuals.py` → `tests/visualization/test_visual_integration.py`
- ✅ Moved `test-sentry.html` → `tests/monitoring/test_sentry_integration.html`
- ✅ Moved `test-server.html` → `tests/visualization/test_server_basic.html`
- ✅ Removed `test.html` (basic debug file)
- ✅ Updated test file paths and imports
- ✅ Maintained test functionality while improving organization

### File Structure Improvements
**Before**:
```
project_root/
├── test_visuals.py          # ❌ Wrong location
├── test-sentry.html         # ❌ Wrong location
├── test-server.html         # ❌ Wrong location
├── test.html                # ❌ Debug file
└── tests/                   # ✅ Proper test directory
```

**After**:
```
project_root/
└── tests/                   # ✅ All tests properly organized
    ├── visualization/
    │   ├── test_visual_integration.py    # ✅ Moved and improved
    │   └── test_server_basic.html        # ✅ Moved and improved
    └── monitoring/
        └── test_sentry_integration.html  # ✅ Moved and improved
```
